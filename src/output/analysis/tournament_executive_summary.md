## Bracket Strategy Tips

**1. Don't pick too many upsets in the first round.**
   While upsets always happen, most 1-4 seeds advance. Focus on the handful of upsets with strong analytical backing.

**2. Look for sleeper teams in the 5-7 seed range.**
   These teams often have similar statistical profiles to top seeds but with lower expectations.

**3. Pay attention to style matchups.**
   Teams that control tempo, shoot well from outside, or have dominant defenses often exceed their seed expectations.

**4. Consider picking at least one non-1 seed in your Final Four.**
   Since 2000, it's extremely rare for all four 1 seeds to make the Final Four (happened only once in 2008).

## Methodology

These predictions combine several analytical approaches:

* **ELO Ratings:** A measure of team strength that updates after every game
* **Efficiency Metrics:** Points scored and allowed per 100 possessions, adjusted for opponent strength
* **Four Factors:** Field goal percentage, turnover rate, offensive rebounding, and free throw rate
* **Recency Factors:** Team momentum, recent performance, and tournament readiness
